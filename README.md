# Game Quest Editor
A project that stores quests and keeps track of quest progressions.

It should be possible to incorporate this project into any game or project but it will mainly be tested and used with the Godot engine.

This project is also a learning experience since I am using CMake for the first time.

## Build
### Linux

To build run:

`cmake .`

`make`

The library is now available as libquestEditor.a

To run the editor go to the editor folder and run the executable:

`cd editor`

`./editor`
